# Prime Product Checker
**WEEK 1**

A positive integer `m` is a prime product if it can be written as `p * q`, where `p` and `q` are both primes.

## Task

Write a Python function `prime_product(m)` that takes an integer `m` as input and returns `True` if `m` is a prime product and `False` otherwise. If `m` is not positive, the function should return `False`.
